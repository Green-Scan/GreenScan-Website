GreenScan - a plant disease detection model 	

	Modern technologies have given human society the ability to produce enough food to meet the demand of more than 7 billion people. However, food security remains threatened by a number of factors including climate change , the decline in pollinators , plant diseases, and others. Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. The combination of increasing global AI based software and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for digital-assisted disease diagnosis. Here, we demonstrate the technical feasibility using a deep learning approach utilizing several images of different crop species with diseases (or healthy) made openly available through the project
	GreenScan is a web application that leverages deep learning to identify plant diseases from images. With its user-friendly interface, users can easily upload or take a photo of a plant to diagnose it for any disease. The application is designed to help farmers and gardeners to detect diseases and take immediate action to mitigate crop damage, reduce the spread of disease, and increase crop yields. The front-end of GreenScan is developed using React JS, while the back-end is handled by FastAPI and TFServing.
	One of the significant advantages of GreenScan is its ability to detect multiple diseases across a wide range of plant species. The deep learning algorithms are trained to detect diseases from 38 classes of images, which have been collected from various sources. When a user uploads an image, the application uses the latest algorithms to identify the type of disease, which is then displayed along with suggested remedies and prevention methods.
	In conclusion, GreenScan is a valuable tool for farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts who want to quickly identify plant diseases and take immediate action to prevent crop damage. The application's user-friendly interface, along with its advanced deep learning algorithms, makes it a effective tool for anyone involved in agriculture or plant care.
